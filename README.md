# :sparkles: What is this Repo?

This is a challenge proposed in the oracle one next education course, in this challenge we have to make a simple site to encrypt and decrypt a text with basic encryption rules, in addition to the basic challenge I decided to use what I learned in the course with what I had been studying abroad and do the same challenge in rust with Yew which is a web framework for Rust similar to javascript react


# :clipboard: How to test

to test this repository just access the pages:

[version Javascript](https://luizlcezario.github.io/OracleOne_Challenge_Encrypt/)

<center>
<img src=".github/page1.png" width="500"/>
</center>

[version Rust](https://luizlcezario.github.io/OracleOne_Challenge_Encrypt/rust/)

<center>
<img src=".github/page2.png" width="500"/>
</center>

if you click in the logo in both pages you will change between then.
